Equipment Cleaning (still in sequence)
Prestart up checks (individual sequence does not matter but should be after equipment cleaning)


Verify if summary is correct or not

Pre-Filtration (CIP, PHT, SIP) (Parallel to all the above processes[Clarification Required])

Filling Line (Parallel to other processes)
Everything in sequence for pre checks
Precommencement check before filling process
Final Filtration start date and time
Actual Filling Line should be after filtration
Take the start and end time of the long list time
Verify summary (after filtration start date and time)
